### **MVP overview**
* **Goal:** This analysis seeks to identify a meaningful, quantifiable relationship between sell-side analyst coverage and a company's fundamentals.
* **Process:** Data exploration to reach this preliminary stage in model development included aggregated company fundamentals scraped from Yahoo Finance, rigorous cleaning of the data in pandas, and construction of a linear regression model utilizing log values for market capitalization, average daily volume, most-recent-quarter assets, latest 12mo revenues, gross margins, operating margins, ROE, and ROA.   
* **Preliminary conclusions:** A cursory regression analysis suggests that there may be meaningful statistical relationships between a company's fundamental factors and its number of publishing sell-side analysts. However, the mean average error of ~4 implies that there are other factors affecting the distribution over-and-above the features I've included in this preliminary analysis.
