### **MVP overview**
* **Goal:** This analysis seeks to establish a meaningfully predictive classification model for identifying high-risk debtors (i.e., at higher risk of default). A model with acceptable accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 may be utilized for more informed lending decisions and proactive solicitation of ancillary financial services related to personal finance. Default-prone lenders comprise a small (~12%) minority of the target distribution, thus emphasizing the importance of model recall for this specific problem. 
* **Process:** The data set leveraged in this analysis was obtained via Kaggle, and is comprised of over 200K observations with 13 features. The raw data set is a balanced mix of quantitative and qualitative features, which required modest cleaning. Categorical features were dummified and numerical features were standardized for modeling.    
* **Preliminary conclusions:** Cursory classification analysis using Logistic Regression and Random Forest models suggests that a tree-based model may have more utility in this business case, evidenced by superior recall and F1 scores compared to the logistic model (see Figures 1 and 2 below). As standalone metrics, the Random Forest model also boasts superior accuracy and precision, though these are of secondary importance given that the default (positive) class is the population of interest.   
* **From here:** This analysis can be expanded by employing boosted tree models, as well as KNN. Time permitting, oversampling and undersampling of the target class ('defaults') may also improve model scoring metrics.
