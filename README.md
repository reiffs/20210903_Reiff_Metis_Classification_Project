### **Project scope**
* **Background:** XXX shrooming'[popularity](https://github.com/reiffs/20210903_Reiff_Metis_Classification_Project/blob/main/graphics/Screen%20Shot%202021-08-25%20at%203.11.29%20PM.png) 
* **Data & implementation:** This analysis will leverage a [public data set](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification) of >8,000 observations with 23 features, including mushroom shape, color, odor, habitat, and many other factors that may elucidate edibility (binary categorical target).   
* **Tool/technology requirements:** This analysis will employ kNN, logistic regression, and other applicable models that are deemed relevant or advantageous post-EDA. Visualizations will be constructed with Seaborn/Matplotlib.      
* **Objective(s):** The objective of this analysis is to build a classification model optimized for accuracy, recall, and precision. An MVP for this project will be a classification model that demonstrates, at the lowest threshold, that edibility can be determined by the other features of the data set superior to naive probability.
