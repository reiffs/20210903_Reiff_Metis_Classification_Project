### **Project scope**
* **Background:** Suprising to some, the [popularity](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=mushrooms) of mushroom collecting as a hobby (or way to eat) is steadily on the rise, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. But how can we be sure (or reasonably confident...) that the 'shrooms we're collecting are safe to eat and handle? Utilizing mushroom qualities like odor, color, and shape, a classification model can be created to address the widely diverse anatomical qualities of mushrooms, labeling them as 'edible' or 'poisonous'. 
* **Data & implementation:** This analysis will leverage a [public data set](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification) of >8,000 observations with 23 features, including mushroom shape, color, odor, habitat, and many other factors that may elucidate edibility (binary categorical target).   
* **Tool/technology requirements:** This analysis will employ kNN, logistic regression, and other applicable models that are deemed relevant or advantageous post-EDA. Visualizations will be constructed with Seaborn/Matplotlib.      
* **Objective(s):** The objective of this analysis is to build a classification model optimized for accuracy, recall, and precision. An MVP for this project will be a classification model that demonstrates, at the lowest threshold, that edibility can be determined by the other features of the data set superior to naive probability.
